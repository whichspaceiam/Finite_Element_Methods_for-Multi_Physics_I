# Finite_Element_Methods_for-Multi_Physics_I
The general procedure to solve coupled muli-field problems with the finite element method is explained. Different, simple couplings like forward coupling (e.g. heat conduction to solid mechanics), direct volume coupling (e.g. piezoelectricity) and interface coupling (e.g. solid mechanics and acoustics) are introduced.
