    "Since the geometry is symmetric, we can cut the geometry into half and take advantage of this symmetry to reduce the size of the computational domain. The interested frequency range of the study is 100 to 1000 Hz, we are analyzing the system at specific frequencies like 100, 400, 700 and 1000 Hz for harmonic analysis. We have also defined the density and compression modulus of air 1.225 kg/m3 and 1.4271 · 105 Pa and the flexible body is constructed from foam with density, Young modulus and Poisson number of 320 kg/m3, 35.3 · 106 Pa and 0.383, respectively.\n",

Consequently, we can observe more peaks in the acoustic pressure, leading to an increase in the occurrence of interferences. These frequencies excite modes of vibration in the solid body, leading to pronounced effects on the acoustic field.\n",

    "Also low natural frequencies don’t seem to significantly impact the pressure field. This can be attributed to the nature of acoustic waves. Acoustic pressure is a measure of the energy carried by the sound waves. Low-frequency vibrations tend to have larger wavelengths and lower energy, which may not significantly impact the pressure field. On the other hand, high-frequency vibrations have shorter wavelengths and higher energy, leading to more noticeable effects on the pressure field.\n",

    "The signal experiences a more rapid damping effect when encountering a rigid scatterer. This can be attributed to the behavior of the rigid body, which tends to reflect a greater portion of the incident waves compared to the flexible scatterer. The increased reflection from the rigid body results in more pronounced destructive interferences, where the reflected waves interfere with the incident waves in a way that diminishes their amplitudes more rapidly. Essentially, the rigid scatterer contributes to a quicker attenuation of the signal in the wave field compared to the flexible counterpart."
